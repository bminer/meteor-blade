============

Meteor Smart Package for Blade - HTML Template Compiler, inspired by Jade &amp; Haml

## Project Status

Meteor support for Blade is a work-in-progress. The Meteor team has been changing the
Templating API for Meteor significantly, and it is quite likely that any code that has
been written for Blade + Meteor support will be very broken in the near future. If you
use Blade with Meteor, please hang in there. Once Meteor 1.0 is released and the APIs
are well-documented, I will work to integrate Blade with Meteor.
